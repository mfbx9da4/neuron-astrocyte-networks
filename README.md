neuron-astrocyte-networks
=========================

Modified feedforward neural network models to represent neuron-astrocyte interactions. 

Includes [Porto-Pazos Model (ppm)](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0019109), genetic algorithms (ga), back propagation(bp) and [my own model (reciprocal astrocyte processing (RAP) model)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8BD2EanwzGQTHJEMlk5dHpITXc/view?usp=sharing).

## To browse source code

 * Find source code of Porto Pazos model (which includes a GA) [here](https://github.com/mfbx9da4/neuron-astrocyte-networks/tree/master/pure_python/ga%2Bppm/main).
 * Find source code for RAP model [here](https://github.com/mfbx9da4/neuron-astrocyte-networks/tree/master/pure_python/rap/main). 
 * Pybrain is a library I have used to experiment with variations of GA, BP and PPM implementations. However final experiments used only pure python (albeit with numpy).
